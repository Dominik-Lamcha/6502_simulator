# 6502 Processor Simulator in C++
Attempt to learn something about 8 bit CPUs with C++ exercising in focus

This repository contains a simulator for the legendary MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, written in C++. The 6502 has played a pivotal role in the personal computer revolution and has been the heart of iconic systems, making it an essential piece of computing history.

## About the 6502 Processor
The MOS Technology 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor that was introduced in 1975. Designed by Chuck Peddle and Bill Mensch, it quickly gained popularity due to its affordability and power. Retailing at a mere $25, when its competitors were often several times more expensive, the 6502 made waves in the electronics industry and was adopted in a variety of products.

### Notable systems powered by the 6502:
The Apple I and Apple II computers
The original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
The Atari 2600 and 8-bit family of home computers
The Commodore PET and Commodore 64
And many more...
This processor, with its rich instruction set and simple architecture, became a favorite for hobbyists, educators, and commercial developers alike.
